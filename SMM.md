### Chapter 0-I Multiply 2-digit numbers by 11

#### Steps

    a. Add the digits.
    b. Put the results between the digits in the number that is not 11.

##### Example

_Problem_: $32 \times 11$

a. $3 + 2 = 5$

b. $352$

---

In some cases, step a results in a two-digit number.  So, the steps become:

    a. Add the digits.
    b. Put the last digit of the results between the digits in the number that is not 11.
    c. Add the first digit of the result to the first original digit.

##### Example

_Problem_: $85 \times 11$

a. $8 + 5 = 13$

b. $835$

c. $935$

---

##### Example (larger problems covered better later)

_Problem_: $314 \times 11$

a. $3 + 1 = 4$, $1 + 4 = 5$

b. $3154$

c. $3454$

### Chapter 0-II Squaring Where a Number Ends With 5

#### Steps

    a. Multiply the first digit by the next higher number.
    b. Put 25 at the end of a's result.

### Chapter 0-III Multiplying Two-Digit Numbers Where the Same First Digit and the second digits sum to 10

#### Steps

## Chapter 1 - Addition and Subtraction

_Tips_:

- Work from right to left.
- Simplify problems into smaller parts.

### Chapter 1-I Simple Addition

#### Steps

    a. Add the tens.
    b. Add the ones.

##### Example

_Problem_: $47 + 32$

a. $47 + 30 = 77$

b. $77 + 2 = 79$

---

### Chapter 1-I Simple Addition

#### Steps

    a. Add the first number to the tens column of the second number.
    b. Add the result to the ones column of the second number.

##### Example

_Problem_: $47 + 32$

a. $47 + 30 = 77$

b. $77 + 2 = 79$

_The above can be read as_:

    47 plus 30 is
    77 plus 2 is
    79

### Chapter 1-II Three-Digit Addition

These are the same steps as in the two-digit version, but with more digits.

_Tips_:

- The goal is to keep simplifying the problem until you are adding a on-digit number.
- To separate the steps, don't try to _see_ the numbers in your head; try to _hear_ them.

#### Steps

    a. Add the first number to the hundreds column of the second number.
    a. Add the result to the tens column of the second number.
    b. Add the result to the ones column of the second number.

##### Example

_Problem_: $538 + 327$

a. $538 + 300 = 838$

b. $838 + 20 = 858$

c. $858 + 7 = 865$

_The above can be read as_:

    538 plus 327 is
    838 plus 20 is
    858 plus 7 is
    865
